The files in these folders are the source files only. 

If you create a new project in PlatformIO, you can copy and paste the code from here into a new file in the project's 'src' folder. That way, your setup matches what you have in your system as opposed to you getting my setup - which is bound to be different!

In addition, the code files here are imported directly into the book - so any changes I make here will be updated in the book too.
