\section*{Dedication}\label{dedication}

This book is dedicated to my wife Alison, who has tolerated my need to `play' with computers for many many years. She doesn't understand how or why I can work with computers all day, then come home and still want to `play' with them in my free time. It's a woman thing - they just don't understand :o)

She thinks that I \emph{need to get a life} - which I think means
\emph{Go shopping}!

Dedicated also to all those \emph{Open Source} people out there, who spend time and effort creating wonderful pieces of software and hardware, they make them all available for free. You know who you are.
