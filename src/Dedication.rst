Dedication
==========

This book is dedicated to my wife Alison, who has tolerated my need to 'play' with computers for many many years. She doesn't understand how or why I can work with computers all day, then come home and still want to 'play' with them in my free time. It's a woman thing - they just don't understand :o) 

She thinks that I *need to get a life* - which I think means *Go shopping*!
